***Suggest API:*** 

To run the program use: java -jar suggestAPI.jar "CITY_NAME"

The app use this API endpoint:

http://api.goeuro.com/api/v2/position/suggest/en/CITY_NAME

Where CITY_NAME is the string that the user has entered as a parameter when calling the tool, e.g.

http://api.goeuro.com/api/v2/position/suggest/en/Berlin

The API endpoint returns JSON documents like these:

```javascript
[

 {

 _id: 377078,
 key: null,
 name: "Potsdam",
 fullName: "Potsdam, Germany",
 iata_airport_code: null,
 type: "location",
 country: "Germany",

 geo_position: {
 latitude: 52.39886,
 longitude: 13.06566
 },
 location_id: 377078,
 inEurope: true,
 countryCode: "DE",
 coreCountry: true,
 distance: null
 },

 {
 _id: 410978,
 key: null,
 name: "Potsdam",
 fullName: "Potsdam, USA",
 iata_airport_code: null,
 type: "location",
 country: "USA",

 geo_position: {
 latitude: 44.66978,
 longitude: -74.98131
 },

 location_id: 410978,
 inEurope: false,
 countryCode: "US",
 coreCountry: false,
 distance: null
 }
 ]
```

The endpoint always responds with a JSON array that contains JSON objects as elements. 
Each object, among other keys, has a name and a geo_position key.
The geo_position key is an object with latitude and longitude fields.

The program should query the API with the user input and create a CSV file from it. 
The CSV file should have the form: _id, name, type, latitude, longitude
